		<p></p>
		<p>Facilitated computer programming lessons with the Summer Coding Workshop run by the Brewster High School Computer Science Club in partnership with Brewster Public Library</p>
		<p>Gained teaching experience by explaining some of the basic concepts of computer programming to 5-7 year old kids through Code.org and 12-17 year old teens through Python Programming Language</p>
		<p>Improved students’ understanding of fundamental programming such as for loops, methods, and variables in order for them to successfully complete each independent problem being given after each main lesson was completed</p>

		<h2>Shinkansen Travel Experience Hackathon Participater</h2>
		<h4>MIT IDSS Data Science & Machine Learning Program Student</h4>
		<img src="pics/mit idss hackathon.png">
		<h4>Open from April 25th, 2025 to April 28th, 2025</h4>
		<p><b>Description:</b> This problem statement is based on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan, and passengers’ experience with that mode of travel. This machine-learning exercise aims to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regard to their contribution to the passengers’ overall travel experience. The dataset contains a random sample of individuals who travelled on this train. The on-time performance of the trains along with passenger information is published in a file named <b><i>‘Traveldata_train.csv’</b></i>.  These passengers were later asked to provide their feedback on various parameters related to the travel, along with their overall experience. These collected details are made available in the survey report labelled <b><i>‘Surveydata_train.csv’</b></i>.
		
		In the survey, each passenger was explicitly asked whether they were satisfied with their overall travel experience or not, and that is captured in the data of the survey report under the variable labelled <b><i>‘Overall_Experience’</b></i>.
		
		The objective of this problem is to understand which parameters play an important role in swaying passenger feedback towards a positive scale. You are provided test data containing the travel data and the survey data of passengers. Both the test data and the train data are collected at the same time and belong to the same population.</p>
		
		<p><b>Goal:</b> Predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train.</p>
