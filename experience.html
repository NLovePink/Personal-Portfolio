			<p>The day began with the General CTF challenge, which we were able to fully complete together. Finishing the entire challenge as a team was definitely a highlight, pushing us to combine our problem-solving skills, think creatively, and stay focused under pressure. After completing the CTF, we spent the rest of the event exploring a variety of information sessions that covered different topics within cybersecurity. Each session offered something new and gave us a deeper insight into the field. Networking was another great part of the day. We met students, professionals, and other security enthusiasts, all of whom added to the sense of community that BSides is known for. And of course, picking up some free merchandise along the way made the experience even more fun. Looking back, BSidesNYC was motivating, educational, and inspiring, and sharing it with Adiel, Tyler, and our fellow CTF teammates Chris Benitez Caballero, and Brandon Tejada made it even better. Experiences like this are a big part of what keeps me excited to continue growing in cybersecurity.</p>
