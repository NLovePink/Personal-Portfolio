# Personal-Portfolio
_Individual semester-long project for CIS 102W - Web Design for Non Profit Organization to make a personal portfolio website._

**Purpose of Website:** The purpose of this website is for me to showcase who I am on a website of my own design which would help fulfill the goal of having all my skills and expertise in a manageable, clean format.

**Target Audience:** Professionals in the tech & various other industries

**Graphics:**	Pictures of computer animation and specific brand names or logos I use or have worked with.

**Color:** Cooler colors such as blue & black but possibly incorporated with pink colors to highlight my personality.

**Accessibility:**	Make some text within my website bigger in certain tabs depending on the amount of information within each section.

**Project Timeline:**	I will continuously be adding onto this website to include further projects or updates regarding any future internships or any other career opportunities I come across in my future.
