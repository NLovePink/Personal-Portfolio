		<h2>Group 2 - Busy Bees</h2>
		<p><i>Final Group project for CIS 102W - Web Design for Non Profit Organization to make a website of our own non-profit organization.</i></p>
		<a href=https://webpage.pace.edu/NL87126P/Group2_Project/index1.html><img src="pics/busy bees logo.png" alt="Busy Bees Logo"></a>
		<p><b>Mission Statement:</b> Busy bees empower underprivileged communities worldwide by delivering educational programs, mobilizing volunteers and supplying essential school resources to children without access to comprehensive education.</p>
		<p><b>Awareness Content:</b> Join us and learn how millions of children around the world are undersupplied with access to basic education – and see how Busy Bees is transforming that. Discover the obstacles they face, from infrastructure to limited schools, lack of qualified teachers and supplies. Our global volunteers and partnership with organizations like First Book and Save the Children are helping to bridge the gap.</p>
		<h2><i>Disclaimer: Much of the information involved in creating this project is completely fictional besides the outside organizations mentioned.</i></h2>
		<p>During our service project, my group and I developed a non-profit organization called Busy Bees, whose mission is dedicated to empowering underprivileged communities worldwide by delivering educational programs, mobilizing volunteers, and providing essential school resources to children without access to comprehensive education. In addition, its vision is to create a world where every child, regardless of geographical circumstance, has access to quality education, essential learning resources, and opportunities needed to build a brighter future through a global community of empowered learners, passionate educators, and dedicated volunteers. Busy Bees strive to eliminate educational inequality and unlock the full potential of every child. Working on this project gave me a deeper understanding of the importance and impact of organized educational initiatives. Our group, Group 2, focused on creating the organization’s website to effectively communicate Busy Bees’ mission and vision to a wider audience. The main purpose of the project was to develop a clear and engaging platform to encourage volunteer participation, attract donations, and share information about community outreach programs. As group leader, I organized our workflow, created GitHub access, and set up folders and HTML files for the website. While I contributed significantly, other group members were essential in shaping Busy Bees’ overall message, branding, and content, ensuring it would resonate with our target audience. I would say our group has been successful in reaching our intended audience, primarily high school students and older volunteers interested in contributing to an international educational organization. We have also made progress in establishing partnerships for donations, supplies, and community outreach and have identified schools and areas in urgent need of support. To stay on track, I created a project checklist to prioritize tasks, which currently includes the mission statement, vision statement, company description, brand logo, and foundation for our website layout. Although some elements are still in progress, we are in a strong position to complete the project on time. Working in a group presented challenges and valuable learning experiences. Scheduling conflicts and the inability to hold synchronous or in-person meetings made collaboration difficult, and we lost a few group members along the way. To overcome these obstacles, we relied on clear communication through our group chat and coordinated responsibilities through email when necessary. By dividing tasks according to each member’s strengths and maintaining consistent communication, we were able to keep the project moving forward. This experience taught me the importance of leadership, organization, and adaptability in managing a team and achieving shared goals. In conclusion, developing Busy Bees has been an enriching experience that allowed me to apply project management and leadership skills while contributing to a meaningful cause. Through teamwork, communication, and careful planning, our group has made significant progress in creating a website that effectively represents our organization and its mission, and I am confident that our continued collaboration will result in a successful final project.</p>
